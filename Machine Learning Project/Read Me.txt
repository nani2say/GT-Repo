Steps to Run the 1st Program(Missing values)
============================================

Source File : MachineLMSQ1/src/QtnV2.java

Step 1: Change the below values in the initial Set of lines. 

        int NUM_OF_COLUMNS =14;  //this is for the first data set
	int NUM_OF_ROWS = 242;   

Step 2: Change the input file name in the read() method.

        XSSFWorkbook workbook = new XSSFWorkbook(new FileInputStream( new File("Q1S1.xlsx"))); //This is the first dataset

Step 3: Run the program and we get the output in the console.

Step 4: we need to paste the output onto an excel file.



Steps to Run the 2nd Program(Classification)
============================================

Source files: DimensionReduction\src\ClassifierKNN.java & Reduction.java

Step1: Generate a set of Serialized files from the Reduction.java

       1.1 Edit the below fields

        int NUM_OF_COLUMNS =  4434;  // for second data set
	int NUM_OF_ROWS = 50;  //This is equal to training+ test, 44+6

       1.2 Edit the file names
           In readLabel() method
            XSSFWorkbook(new FileInputStream( new File("L2.xlsx"))); //This is the filename with labels
        
           In read() method          
            new XSSFWorkbook(new FileInputStream( new File("T2.xlsx"))); 
              // ****** T2.xlsx has the training data + Test Data

Output : We get *.ser files

Step 2:  Perform the classification

       2.1 Change the below fields
        
        int NUM_OF_COLUMNS = 4434;  //for dataset 2
	int NUM_OF_ROWS = 50;  //test+train number of rows
	int ORG_ROWS =44; //training data rows
	int NUM_LABELS =4; // number of labels 
	int START =44; //starting row index of testdata
	int label[]= {1,2,3,4}; //actual labels

        
	int dimensions =46; // Set 2 - 46, set 1 -25 => Most appropriate vnumber of Eigen vectors considered
	int k=7;  // this is defined as root of number of rows (sqrt(50) =7) 
        
       2.2 Change the input file
           XSSFWorkbook(new FileInputStream( new File("L2.xlsx"))); // Labels file for 2nd Set

Step 3: Execute to see the results
